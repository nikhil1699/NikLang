Step 2  : Create a lexer, A lexer will go through input character by character and will give us tokens(Object with some type)
Step 3  : We create the parser, which takes in the tokens created by the lexer and builds up what we call an abstract syntax tree, which is basically a tree of the structure of the code. We can then traverse that tree
